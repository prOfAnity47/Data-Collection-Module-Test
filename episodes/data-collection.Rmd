## Introduction

This episode introduces sources and strategies for collecting geospatial data from online repositories and satellite archives. Learners will explore freely available imagery sources, walk through the process of downloading CORONA and Sentinel-2 imagery, and begin building a GIS project using QGIS.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Consider having learners work in pairs for the download tasks. If download speeds are slow, instructors may wish to prepare example datasets ahead of time.

## Acquiring Raster Data from Online Repositories

Raster datasets such as scanned maps and satellite images are available from various sources. These can be used as contextual layers or digitized for analysis.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge 1: Explore Raster Data Repositories

Visit the following websites and locate at least one map or image relevant to your research or region of interest.

- [PCL Map Collection](https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/)
- [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/)
- [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/)
- [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)
- [ESA Copernicus Browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/)

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Download an image or scanned map and save it to a folder for later use. Note whether the file is georeferenced or if georeferencing will be required.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Downloading Historical CORONA Imagery

CORONA imagery provides historic satellite photos with moderate spatial resolution and high historical value for landscape and archaeological studies.

Steps:
- Visit [CAST](https://corona.cast.uark.edu/)
- Explore available red boxes indicating mission areas
- Download a GeoTIFF file of a CORONA scene
- Load the file into QGIS using Raster > Add Layer

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge 2: Practice Downloading CORONA Imagery

Find and download a CORONA image from CAST or EarthExplorer.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Open QGIS, navigate to the Raster tab, and add the downloaded CORONA GeoTIFF image.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Searching Raw CORONA Imagery via USGS EarthExplorer

EarthExplorer allows you to access full CORONA archives. Login required.

1. Create a polygon for your area of interest.
2. Under Data Sets, select `Declassified Data > Declass 1 (1996)`.
3. Filter by camera resolution: Stereo High.
4. Explore metadata and preview images.
5. Download imagery and extract `.tar` files using 7-Zip.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Encourage learners to explore metadata and preview before downloading large files.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Downloading Sentinel-2 Imagery from ESA Copernicus

Steps:
- Register at [ESA Copernicus](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/)
- Use the map interface to select AOI
- Apply filters: date range, cloud cover, Sentinel-2
- Visualize band combinations (NDVI, true color, etc.)
- Download and extract SAFE.ZIP files

## Summary

Learners now know how to access multiple online repositories for raster imagery and begin building GIS projects using these sources.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Historical raster data provides valuable geospatial context
- CORONA and Sentinel-2 imagery are accessible through public archives
- QGIS supports raster and vector integration
- Georeferencing is often necessary for older raster scans
