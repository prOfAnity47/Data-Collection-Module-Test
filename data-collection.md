## Introduction

This episode introduces sources and strategies for collecting geospatial data from online repositories and satellite archives. Learners will explore freely available imagery sources, walk through the process of downloading CORONA and Sentinel-2 imagery, and begin building a GIS project using QGIS.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Consider having learners work in pairs for the download tasks. If download speeds are slow, instructors may wish to prepare example datasets ahead of time.

## Acquiring Raster Data from Online Repositories

Raster datasets such as scanned maps and satellite images are available from various sources.These can be used as contextual layers or digitized for analysis.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge 1: Explore Raster Data Repositories

Visit the following websites and locate at least one map or image relevant to your research or region of interest:

- [PCL Map Collection](https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/)
- [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/)
- [Old Maps Online](https://www.oldmapsonline.org/)
- [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)
- [ESA Copernicus Browser](https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/)

:::::::::::::::::::: solution

Download an image or scanned map and save it to a folder for later use. Note whether the file is georeferenced or if georefrencing will be required.
